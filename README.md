# CASHFLOW Game

## **Project Overview**

This project aims to develop a web-based version of the popular Cashflow board game, originally created by Robert Kiyosaki. The web app will enable users to play the game in a single-player mode, providing a digital platform to experience the core financial education concepts presented in the game.

## **Purpose**

The primary purpose of this project is twofold:

1. **Personal Portfolio:** The development of this web app will serve as a showcase of my skills and experience as a web developer, demonstrating my ability to create interactive and engaging user experiences.
2. **Personal Use:** The app will be used for personal enjoyment and learning, allowing me to revisit the financial principles presented in the Cashflow game.

## **Scope**

- The project will focus on creating a functional and user-friendly single-player version of the Cashflow game.
- The initial release will not include multiplayer features, user authentication (sign in/sign up)
- The game can only be play on one-go, there will be no save/load feature in the initial version.
